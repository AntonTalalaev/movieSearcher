# Notes:
- Documentation: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction.
- If project will generate profit need to check Agreenment with TMDb (Terms of Use - https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api/new?type=developer). I got API key for a non-profit professional, there is a key for profitable projects.
- Language support on TMDb - https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/languages
- You can authenticate TMDb users within your application to extend the TMDb experience within your application. This will let your users do things like rate movies, maintain their favourite and watch lists as well as do things like create and edit custom listsâ€”all while staying in sync with their account on TMDb. 
  https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/authentication
- Add TMDb attribution. TMDb is free to use as long as you properly attribute us as the source of the data and/or images you use. 
  You can find the logos for attribution https://www.themoviedb.org/about/logos-attribution
